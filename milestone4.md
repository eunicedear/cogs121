## Improvements to UI
Since Milestone 3, we added a Google sign-in functionality on the login page with which the user can sign in with his/her Google account. We have also included an accounts page in which parents can create separate “accounts” for each individual child. From this page, the child can go into his/her account where his/her pet and habits are stored. We also improved upon our UI skeleton by adding relevant icons to the ‘closet’ and ‘store’ pages and added the functionality of keeping track of the number of points that the user has before and after purchasing an accessory.

## Addressing User Privacy
Our app ensures that we do not obtain any information the user did not voluntarily provide when signing up or logging into the app. This information will not be shared publicly to any outside source and will be kept within that particular account (for the parent and child under the same account).
