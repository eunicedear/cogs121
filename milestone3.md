## Explanation
Our screenshots of our UI skeleton webpages are similar to our prototypes because after receiving feedback about our prototypes, we felt like our current design was appropriate and feasible to implement. We decided to move forward with our second prototype (the more playful one) because it keeps users accountable and visualizes user data in a fun and playful way, thus making this design more visually unique.
