## Improvements to UI
Since Milestone 4, we have added more functionality to our habits page.  After the user adds a new habit, that data will be displayed on the frontend/UI. We have also created an accounts page that will hold all the child accounts under the parent's account. Adding a new child will have the same functionality as adding a new habit. From this, the user can navigate to their homepage (that displays their pet) and therefore the habits page. We also added an option for the user to edit their existing information about their habits. We did this by creating a modal with the existing data, and you can directly edit the information in the modal to make the changes to be saved.
