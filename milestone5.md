## Improvements to UI
Since Milestone 4, we have added more functionality to our accounts and habits page. For example, after the user adds a new child or habit, that data will be displayed on the frontend/UI. From this, the user can  navigate to their homepage (that displays their pet) and therefore the habits page. We also added an option for the user to edit their existing information about their habits. We did this by creating a modal with the existing data, and you can directly edit the information in the modal to make the changes.

## Non-trivial action 1
Our app ensures that we do not obtain any information the user did not voluntarily provide when signing up or logging into the app. This information will not be shared publicly to any outside source and will be kept within that particular account (for the parent and child under the same account).
