## Improvements to UI
Since Milestone 4, we have added more functionality to our habits page.  After the user adds a new habit, that data will be displayed on the frontend/UI. We have also created an accounts page that will hold all the child accounts under the parent's account. Adding a new child will have the same functionality as adding a new habit. From this, the user can navigate to their homepage (that displays their pet) and therefore the habits page. We also added an option for the user to edit their existing information about their habits. We did this by creating a modal with the existing data, and you can directly edit the information in the modal to make the changes to be saved.

## Non-trivial action 1
One main action that the user can perform is navigating through the entire process of creating a habit. This means that the user can login, choose a child account, go to their habits page, and create a new habit. After they create a new habit, this habit will be displayed on the page. If they wish to change and edit the habit (e.g. change the date, name, etc.), then they can click on the habit to change its information.

## Non-trivial action 2
A second action that the user can perform is utilizing the pet's closet and store feature. Since the user will have a certain amount of points accrued by completing their habits, they can buy certain items, which will belong to the user in their closet. By clicking on the accessories, you can see the pet wearing one item at a time.
