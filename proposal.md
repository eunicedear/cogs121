### Project Proposal
1. **Habit Building App**
   The user can enter a habit they want to build or get rid of.  Every time they complete the habit or every day they complete the activity,  the app will keep track of their progress and reward them accordingly. The progress will be shown as a point system (or something similar) which will motivate the user to reach their goal.

2. **Wishlist Tracking App**
   The user enters a link for an Amazon product they want to keep an eye on, and the web app will keep track of price changes and show similar products. The user can be notified (if they choose) if a watched itemâ€™s price dips.
